Linux Distribution: Ubuntu 18.04 LTS

Submission complete - used build_and_install.sh instead of Make files.

Build Instructions: build_and_install.sh



Design:
shared_client.so makes use of System V message Queues to send allocation/free
  events to stat_server.

shared_client makes use of System V shared memory to implement a spin lock using atomic
  instructions. stat_server initializes spin lock which means it needs to be started
  first.

Files:
1. shared_client.c // shared library 
2. test.cpp 	   // test app
3. stat_server.cpp // statistics server
4. stat_server.h   // used by stat_server.cpp and shared_client

Files after building:
1. libshared_client.so
2. test
3. stat_server

Testing using LD_PRELOAD:
1. test which tests multi-threaded and recursion
2. 'find' with over 21,000 jpg files
